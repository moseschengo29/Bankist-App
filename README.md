# Bankist-App

This is a demo bankist app that has a login functionality that enables a user to login and view their history. The user is also able to transfer money from one user to another and also request a loan. It also has a timer of 20 minutes to detect when the user is not active. But the timer is reset when the user sends money to another account or requests a loan(SHows any activty).

To be able to log in and use the app there are several login users as follows:

1. username: mc ~ password: 1111
2. username: ml ~ password: 2222
